# Bayesian Homework 3

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook **HW3.ipynb**, which focuses on Bayesian statistical analysis. The notebook includes theoretical explanations, data analysis, and Python code implementations related to Bayesian inference.

## Summary

This notebook demonstrates three questions related to Bayesian inference with a **normal likelihood** and two different priors, as well as a conceptual discussion about multinomial-Dirichlet. Specifically:

- **Q1**: Implement a Gibbs sampler for a normal model with unknown mean and precision using a flat prior.
- **Q2**: Extend the Gibbs sampler to use a Normal-Gamma prior. Compare the impact of different prior hyperparameters.
- **Q3**: Generate posterior predictive samples and visualize the uncertainty in future predictions.
